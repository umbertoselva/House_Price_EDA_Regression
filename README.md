# Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression on a House Price Dataset

This notebook contains a step-by-step example of how to apply Data Science to a Regression task. The goal is to fit a Machine Learning model to predict the price of residential houses on the basis of a large dataset containing a variety of explanatory variables (from the living area squared meters to the number of bedrooms). I conduct exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature selection, model design, training, evaluation and model explainability.
